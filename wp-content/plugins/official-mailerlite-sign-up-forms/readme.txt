The Official MailerLite signup forms plugin makes it easy to grow your newsletter subscriber list from your WordPress blog or website. The plugin automatically integrates your Wordpress form with your MailerLite email marketing account.

Once you activate the plugin, you’ll be able to select and add any of the pre-built webforms from your MailerLite account or create a new form from scratch. You can place the form in the sidebar using a widget or use a shortcode to put it wherever you want.

Setup is fast and easy! You just need to enter your MailerLite account API code and you’re all set.

Plugin features include:

* Easily-to-add webforms from MailerLite to your WordPress blog or website
* Option to create new webforms

= How can I style the sign-up form? =

You can use CSS rules to style the sign-up form, use the following CSS selectors to target the various form elements.

Every form can be different, because element ID of form is:

Elements of form can be styled.

`
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-title {} /* the form title */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-description {} /* the form description */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-field label {} /* the form input label */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-field input {} /* the form inputs */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-loader {} /* the form loading text */

.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-subscribe-button-container .mailerlite-subscribe-submit {} /* the form submit button */
.mailerlite-form .mailerlite-form-response {} /* the form response message */
`

Add your custom CSS rules to the end of your theme stylesheet, /wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css. Do not add them to the plugin stylesheet as they will be automatically overwritten on the next plugin update.
